# The RTE License

Copyright (c) Recep Tayyip Erdogan

The oft forgiving and most merciful ruler, Recep Tayyip Erdogan ("RTE") hereby grants, ex gratia, to any person accepting his magnanimous sovereign, the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of this software and its associated documentation files (the "Software"), under the following conditions:

Marginal groups, including but not limited to anti-government protestors ("Capulcu"), and any corporation, government body or similar party ("Mihrak") with an evil intent such as undermining Turkey's economical greatness or overthrowing its advanced democracy are strictly prohibited from using the Software for their nefarious purposes. Possession, reproduction, transmission and all other applications of the Software by a Capulcu or Mihrak are punishable under law.

The license is valid from time immemorial until after the end of time, unless RTE explicitly states that he finds the timing significant and worthy of contemplation. After RTE disavows his grace upon it, the license will be considered merely an exclusive license for rich-text editors, run-time engines or another asset with the same initials, effective immediately.
